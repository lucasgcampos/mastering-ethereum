# Mastering Ethereum - Code Examples  

This repository contains code examples and practical implementations based on the book **[Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)** by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood. This book is an excellent reference for developers looking to learn about Ethereum, smart contracts, and the blockchain ecosystem.  

## ðŸ“š About the Book  

*Mastering Ethereum* is an essential read for blockchain developers and enthusiasts, covering topics such as:  
- Ethereum architecture and fundamentals  
- Smart contract development with Solidity  
- Building dApps (Decentralized Applications)  
- Tools like Truffle, Ganache, Metamask, and others  
- Security and best practices for Ethereum development  

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites  

To run the code examples, you will need to install:  
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)*  
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (Browser extension)  

*The book use Truffle and Ganache to execute the smartcontracts, but I adjust the samples and use Foundry.
